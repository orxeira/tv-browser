# Orxeira's TV
This is a simple excercise in Android architecture. This app will use the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) REST API to serve a basic list of the currently highest rated TV shows with a simple detail view. Internally it will use Android Architecture with MVVM and data binding.
## Build Requirements
For this app to work you must add your own [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API key in the api_key.xml
